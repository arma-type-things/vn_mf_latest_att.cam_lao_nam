    Description:
        The day/night cycle subsystem manages speeding up/slowing down the day-night cycle.
		Due to Arma constraints, the shortest possible day or night is 12 minutes.
		This initialises the subsystem.
    
    Parameter(s):
        _dawnLength - Length of dawn in seconds [NUMBER]
        _dayLength - Length of each day in seconds [NUMBER]
        _duskLength - Length of dusk in seconds [NUMBER]
		_nightLength - Length of each night in seconds [NUMBER]
    
    Returns:
        Function reached the end [BOOL]
    
    Example(s):
		//Initialises the day night subsystem with 24 minute days and 12 minute nights.
        [1440, 0.5] call para_s_fnc_day_night_subsystem_init
